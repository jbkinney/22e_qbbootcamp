    "In this course we will focus on the Python programming language. There are a number of reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is one of the easiest languages to learn, to write, and to read.** More than almost any other programming language,  Python code looks like pseudocode. Many aspects of the language help to enforce clarity. There is also a set of convensions, called the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), that most programmers have adopted to make their code as clear as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python allows you to create new code fast**. It is designed to allow you to write programs as quickly and as painlessly as possible. One feature of Python that enables rapid prototyping is that it is an \"interpreted\" language: each line is executed by the Python interpreter one after the next. This is different than C, C++, or Java, which require that programs first be \"compiled\", i.e. translated in their entirety from code to byte code before they are run. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is very flexible.** With Python you can do image analysis, sequence analysis, exploratory data analysis, and create publication-quality figures. You can write small analysis scripts or write major software applications. You can use Python at the command line, within a Jupyter notebook (such as this), or within an interactive programming environment. My lab programs almost exclusively in Python in our day-to-day work. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is well-supported.** There is an enormous user base for Python. This means that a simlpe Google search  can usually answer any Python programming question you have. There are also a large number of mature 3rd party packages for a wide variety of tasks including image analysis, numerical computation, machine learning, statistics, and graphics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python skills are highly valued.** There is great demand for people who know Python, and that demand is rapidly increasing. This is true in both academic research and in industry. In particular, Python has become the de facto language of deep learning. "

They allow you to include fully functional Python code inside of a document that also contains markdown (i.e. text like this) and figures that show analysis results. This type of hybrid document provides a powerful method of interactive data anlysis. I encourage taking advantage of this. In fact I use Jupyter notebooks for most of my data analysis tasks. Only when I start writing production code do I switch over to more standard Python scripts. "
